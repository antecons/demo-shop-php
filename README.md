Demo Shop
=========

A simple shop implementation to demonstrate how the Antecons
API can be integrated with any custom webshop.

*** Not Maintained ***
--------------
It is probably evident from the old commit history, but this repository is not maintained anymore.

Requirements
------------

* PHP 5
* curl
* json
* possibly others as well.

Installation and setup
----------------------

You probably don't want to run this shop since it is very specific to Antecons
:-)

But if you feel like doing it anyway:

* Download latest version
* Rename `config-sample.php` to `config.php`
* Enter your API key and secret
